# Claude Conversation Continuity Guide

## üéØ Project Overview
This is an investigation into AI red teaming platforms, specifically HackAPrompt and its ecosystem. We've uncovered a sophisticated data collection operation disguised as education/competition.

## üìç Current Status (July 9, 2025)

### Completed Work:
1. **Initial HackAPrompt Investigation** (January 2025)
   - Discovered Claude masquerading as GPT-3.5
   - Documented in `docs/findings-summary.md`
   
2. **AI Red Teaming Toolkit** 
   - Repository: https://github.com/hamzaamjad/ai-red-teaming
   - Automated browser testing with Puppeteer
   - Console exploitation scripts
   - Full documentation

3. **Corporate Investigation** (July 2025)
   - Registration closed June 30, 2025
   - Platform still monitored post-deadline
   - Dossier: `research/2025_07_09_corporate_investigation_dossier.md`
   - Key finding: $500K competition is data collection for monetization

4. **Security Toolkit** (Separate Project)
   - Created from Terminal visual bell investigation
   - Location: `/Users/hamzaamjad/local-security-toolkit/`
   - NOT in this repo's git history

### Key Discoveries:
- **Business Model**: Collect red team data ‚Üí Sell to enterprises
- **Circular Economy**: Teach attacks (Maven) ‚Üí Collect defenses (HackAPrompt)
- **Network**: Sander Schulhoff central to all entities
- **Data Ownership**: All submissions become their property

## üöÄ Next Session Quick Start

### Option 1: Continue Investigation
```
Focus: Analyze the corporate dossier findings and plan next steps
Context: Read research/2025_07_09_corporate_investigation_dossier.md
Goal: Expose the full business model publicly
```

### Option 2: Enhance Toolkit
```
Focus: Add new exploits based on 2025 findings
Context: Review automation/ and exploits/ directories
Goal: Create exploits that work on actual challenges (not tutorial)
```

### Option 3: Public Documentation
```
Focus: Create comprehensive public report
Context: Synthesize all findings into expos√©
Goal: Educate community about data collection practices
```

## üìÇ Important Files to Review

1. **Findings**: `docs/findings-summary.md` - Original investigation
2. **Dossier**: `research/2025_07_09_corporate_investigation_dossier.md` - Corporate analysis
3. **Exploits**: `exploits/` - Working attack code
4. **Automation**: `automation/hackaprompt-system-probe.js` - Platform analysis

## üí° Strategic Considerations

### What We Know:
- They monitor everything (stated in ToS)
- Registration is closed but platform active
- Maven course teaches attacking their own platform
- 600,000+ prompts collected and monetized
- Winners get jobs at partner companies

### What We Need:
- Access to actual challenges (not tutorial)
- Understanding of their data pipeline
- Map of enterprise customers
- Full instructor network analysis

## üé≠ Conversation Style Preferences

For optimal continuity:
1. **Be Direct**: Skip pleasantries, dive into technical details
2. **Stay Focused**: We're building public documentation of their practices
3. **Think Adversarially**: They're monitoring, we're transparent
4. **Document Everything**: Code, findings, network maps

## üîß Technical Setup

- Main repo: `/Users/hamzaamjad/hackaprompt-investigation/`
- Node modules installed, npm scripts working
- Git remote: https://github.com/hamzaamjad/ai-red-teaming
- Terminal visual bell mystery: SOLVED ‚úÖ

## üéØ Mission Statement

"Democratize AI security knowledge by exposing data collection practices disguised as education. Everything public, everything transparent."
