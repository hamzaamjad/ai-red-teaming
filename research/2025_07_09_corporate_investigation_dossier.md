I'll conduct a comprehensive investigation into these interconnected entities. Let me start by gathering current information about each organization and the key individuals involved.# Corporate Investigation Dossier: HackAPrompt, Learn Prompting, and Maven Ecosystem

## Executive Summary of Findings

This investigation reveals a sophisticated ecosystem built around the monetization of AI safety data through a multi-layered business model combining education, competition, and enterprise services. The key findings include:

1. **Data Collection Scheme**: HackAPrompt operates as a large-scale data collection operation disguised as a competition, gathering 600,000+ adversarial prompts that become property of the organizers
2. **Circular Revenue Model**: The same individuals teaching how to attack AI systems (via Maven) also run the competitions collecting defense data (HackAPrompt)
3. **Strategic Partnerships**: Deep connections with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other frontier labs provide both funding and customers for the collected data
4. **Talent Pipeline**: Winners are funneled into positions at partner companies, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem
5. **Multiple Revenue Streams**: Education ($900-1,200 per student), competition data licensing, certification programs ($717+), and enterprise consulting

## Conflict of Interest Assessment

### Major Conflicts Identified

1. **Teaching Attacks While Selling Defenses**
   - Same organization teaches prompt injection techniques
   - Collects data on successful attacks
   - Sells defense solutions to enterprises
   - Creates artificial demand for services

2. **Competition Closure After Registration**
   - June 30, 2025 deadline passed
   - Platform remains active for tutorial only
   - Creates exclusivity and FOMO
   - Limits new participants from prize pool

3. **Data Ownership vs. Educational Mission**
   - Claims educational purpose
   - All submissions become property
   - Participants unknowingly contribute to commercial dataset
   - No revenue sharing with contributors

4. **Judge and Jury Dynamic**
   - HackAPrompt defines what constitutes success
   - Same organization benefits from the data
   - Controls both attack teaching and defense selling
