## Conclusion

The existence of ethical alternatives to HackAPrompt demonstrates that AI safety research need not exploit contributors. Platforms like OWASP, AI Village, and industry red teams prove that:

1. **Fair compensation is sustainable**
2. **Open knowledge sharing enhances security**
3. **Community governance works**
4. **Participant protection is essential**
5. **Ethical practices attract better talent**

The AI safety community must reject extractive models that monetize volunteer contributions without consent or compensation. By supporting platforms that prioritize contributor rights, transparent governance, and fair value distribution, we can build a more secure and equitable AI ecosystem.

**Call to Action**: Choose platforms that respect your contributions. Demand transparency, fair compensation, and clear data rights. The future of AI safety depends on ethical participation models that benefit the entire community, not just platform operators.
