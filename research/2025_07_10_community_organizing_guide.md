# Community Organizing Guide: Building Power in AI Labor
## Strategies for Collective Action and Worker Protection

*Investigation Date: July 10, 2025*  
*Status: PUBLIC - Organizing Resource*

---

## Executive Summary

This guide provides practical strategies for AI workers, competition participants, and data laborers to organize collectively for fair treatment. Drawing from successful campaigns like the Alphabet Workers Union and platform cooperative movements, we outline:

- **Organizing tactics** from workplace mapping to collective bargaining
- **Legal frameworks** protecting organizing rights
- **Digital tools** for secure coordination
- **Victory case studies** demonstrating effective strategies
- **Resources** for immediate action

The evidence is clear: organized workers win. From Appen contractors securing reinstatement to data annotators building cooperatives, collective action transforms exploitative conditions into sustainable livelihoods.

## 1. Understanding Your Rights

### 1.1 Legal Protections for Organizing
**U.S. National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)**:
```
Protected Activities:
✓ Discussing wages and working conditions
✓ Forming or joining unions
✓ Collective bargaining
✓ Striking and picketing
✓ Seeking better terms

Employer Violations:
✗ Retaliation for organizing
✗ Surveillance of union activities
✗ Threatening job loss
✗ Interrogating about union support
✗ Promising benefits to stop organizing
```

### 1.2 International Labor Standards
**ILO Conventions**:
- Convention 87: Freedom of Association
- Convention 98: Right to Organize
- Convention 154: Collective Bargaining
- Digital Labor Principles (2024)

### 1.3 Gig Worker Protections
**Recent Legal Victories**:
1. **YouTube Music contractors**: NLRB ruled Google as joint employer
2. **Appen workers**: Successful unfair labor practice charges
3. **EU Platform Work Directive**: Presumption of employment status
4. **California AB5**: ABC test for independent contractors

## 2. Mapping Your Workplace

### 2.1 Power Structure Analysis
```
Identifying Decision Makers:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Platform Executives   │ ← Ultimate power
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Regional Managers     │ ← Policy implementation
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Team Leads/Reviewers  │ ← Daily decisions
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Senior Workers        │ ← Informal influence
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Regular Workers       │ ← Collective power
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Worker Assessment Tool
```python
class WorkplaceMapper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workers = {}
        self.issues = []
        self.supporters = []
    
    def map_coworker(self, name, info):
        self.workers[name] = {
            'contact': info['contact'],
            'shifts': info['shifts'],
            'issues': info['top_concerns'],
            'support_level': info['union_interest'],  # 1-5 scale
            'influence': info['peer_influence'],
            'skills': info['organizing_skills']
        }
    
    def identify_leaders(self):
        return [name for name, info in self.workers.items()
                if info['support_level'] >= 4 and info['influence'] >= 4]
    
    def find_common_issues(self):
        all_issues = [issue for worker in self.workers.values()
                      for issue in worker['issues']]
        return Counter(all_issues).most_common(5)
```

### 2.3 Issue Identification
**Common AI Worker Grievances**:
1. **Wage Theft**: Unpaid training/qualification tasks
2. **Job Insecurity**: Sudden deactivations
3. **Algorithmic Management**: Opaque task allocation
4. **No Benefits**: Healthcare, sick leave, retirement
5. **Isolation**: No colleague communication channels

- **U**nion: Build toward collective power

**Sample Script**:
> "Hey Sarah, I noticed you mentioned the sudden pay cut last week. That happened to me too—lost $200. Have you talked to others experiencing this? I've been connecting with folks to see if we can address this together..."

### 3.3 Security Practices
```python
# Secure communication setup
def setup_organizing_security():
    tools = {
        'messaging': 'Signal or Element',

## 8. Overcoming Common Obstacles

### 8.1 Company Union-Busting
**Typical Tactics & Responses**:

| Company Tactic | Worker Response |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Captive audience meetings | Know your right to leave |
| One-on-one interrogations | Bring a witness, stay silent |
| Sudden policy improvements | "Too little, too late" message |
| Firing organizers | Immediate NLRB charges |
| Algorithm changes to divide | Document everything |

### 8.2 Worker Fears
**Inoculation Scripts**:
> "I understand you're worried about retaliation. That's exactly why we need to stick together. They can't fire all of us, and we have legal protections. Here's what happened when Appen tried that..."

### 8.3 Sustaining Momentum
```
Organizer Wellness Checklist:
□ Regular days off from organizing
□ Shared leadership (no heroes)
□ Celebrate small wins
□ Learn from setbacks
□ Maintain life outside organizing
□ Access to counseling support
□ Conflict resolution processes
□ Clear boundaries
