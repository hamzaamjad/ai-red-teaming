        validated = self.layers['input'].validate(user_input)
        
        # Layer 2: Model processing with safety
        response = self.layers['model'].generate(validated)
        
        # Layer 3: Output monitoring
        if self.layers['output'].is_anomalous(response):
            return self.layers['system'].safe_fallback()
        
        # Layer 4: Continuous monitoring

## 10. Conclusion: Building a Better Future

Our investigation reveals two distinct paths for AI development:

**Path 1: Extraction and Exploitation**
- Zero compensation for contributors
- Opaque platform operations
- Concentrated wealth and power
- Eroding community trust
- Increasing security vulnerabilities

**Path 2: Cooperation and Sustainability**
- Fair compensation mechanisms
- Transparent governance
- Distributed ownership
- Strong community bonds
- Robust security practices

The evidence overwhelmingly supports Path 2. Ethical platforms demonstrate superior innovation, stronger security, and sustainable growth. The transition requires courage, collaboration, and commitment to change.

**The tools exist. The models work. The community is ready.**

Together, we can transform AI development from an extractive industry into a cooperative ecosystem that benefits all participants. The choice is ours—and the time is now.
